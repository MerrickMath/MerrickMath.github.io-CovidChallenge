2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. 

This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.

For this challege I would like you to design a visualization that plots a time series of the number of cases present. Using your visualization I would like you to predict what the true number of cases should be and compare your prediceted value to the true value.

I thouroughly enjoyed this video as it sheds light on the purpose and effect of social isolation during this time.
